# northern-lights

The CCS / Northern Lights hackathon project at TRANSFORM 2021.

The current activity is to create [a benchmark dataset](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2019/4/3/what-makes-a-good-benchmark-dataset) from what is available. That is, 'machine learning ready', open formats, etc. Equinor is looking at the licence because that is not currently fully open.


## Dataset

The dataset is available from [Equinor's `data` site](https://data.equinor.com/dataset/NorthernLights).

Read about accessing and exploring the dataset [on SubsurfWiki](https://subsurfwiki.org/wiki/Northen_Lights_dataset).


## Project

Most of the functional parts of this repo are in [`nl_project`](/nl_project).
